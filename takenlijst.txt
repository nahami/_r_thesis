As both Marc and Marieke already pointed out to me the previous week, 
I should take care when splitting the data for training/testing. 
I think this is one of the main reasons why the prediction is not so good.

Main points for next week are:
- Make an overview (map) of stations in citys, rdam adam & eindhoven- 
- Download data of Rdam and Eindhoven
- Go through the preprocessing steps described by Max Kuhn in the caret package (for currently used data)
- Choose a specific day, ideal for the observation of UHI
- Retrain using different splitting strategy
- Add variables to dataset (LC, sun elevation, nearest KNMI AWS)
